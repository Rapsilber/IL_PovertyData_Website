This is a project for my CS435 - Software Engineering course. I was the project leader, managing our team of three to develop and website to import US Census data on Illinois poverty and display the selected counties' data. I was in charge of keeping the team on track, setting up the PivotalTracker / AGILE planning, and creating and designing the website using React.

Included are the files for the React website, as well as screenshots of the website in action.
